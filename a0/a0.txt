Problem-1

i) inputs: people, individuals output: a list of the matches

ii) Let's say that we have a group of people and their universities as input. We want to match these people 
with their own different universities. At the end, we will have a matched list as output.

Problem-2

i)
    Initialize all men and women to free
    while there is a single free man m who has a woman w to propose to
        w := the first woman who m has not yet proposed to her and in m's list
        if w is free then
            m and w become engaged
        else some pair such that m'and w already exists
            if w prefers m to m' then
                m' becomes free
                m and w become engaged 
            else
                m'and w remain engaged
            end if
        end if
    repeat
ii) Let's say that # of men = # of women = n then we can say that 2*n*n then complexity becomes O(n^2)

Problem-3
men = {A, B, C, D}
women = {J, K, L, M}
